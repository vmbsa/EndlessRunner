# EndlessRunner

In a group of work, we created a 3D game like Subway Surfers, where the user could choose a character and run infinitely, collecting coins and avoiding collisions with obstacles that were being randomly generated. Some power-ups were also being randomly generated along the way, that helped the player. The number of coins was saved so that the player would not lose its progress when the game was closed.
